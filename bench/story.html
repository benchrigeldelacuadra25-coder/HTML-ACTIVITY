        <h2>Beginning</h2>
        <p>
            Many years ago, San Isidro was peaceful. The people worked together in the fields, shared meals after harvest, and honored nature. Living just outside the village was Aling Sabela, a quiet woman who knew the names of plants and the language of the forest. She helped mothers during childbirth and cured fevers using herbs.
        </p>
		<P>
			However, when a series of tragedies struck—failed crops, sudden sickness, and unexplained deaths—the villagers searched for someone to blame. Aling Sabela’s isolation and knowledge made her an easy target. Rumors spread that she whispered to spirits at night and used dolls made of cloth and twine. Fear slowly turned into hatred.

            As the years passed, Aling Sabela became known only as the mangkukulam. Villagers avoided her path, and even animals seemed to flee when her name was spoken. Yet one person questioned the truth—Iñigo, a young boy whose mother had once been healed by Aling Sabela.
        </p>
        <p>
           One night, when Iñigo’s younger sister became dangerously ill, no healer in the village could help. Desperate, Iñigo broke the village rules and went to Aling Sabela’s hut. Instead of curses, he found shelves filled with dried leaves, roots, and old handwritten prayers.
        </p>
		<P>
			Aling Sabela explained that she practiced ancient healing, not dark magic. She warned Iñigo that fear had poisoned the village more than any illness. Still, she agreed to help, knowing the risk of being blamed again.

        <h2>Ending</h2>
        <p>
           Aling Sabela saved the child, but when the villagers found out, they surrounded her hut. Expecting anger, they were instead met with calm. Aling Sabela spoke of truth, forgiveness, and how fear creates monsters where none exist.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ashamed, the villagers begged her to return and lead them again as a healer. But Aling Sabela refused. She believed her presence would always awaken old fears. Before sunrise, she left San Isidro, disappearing into the forest.
        </p>
		<p>
			Years later, peace returned to the village, but Aling Sabela was never seen again.
