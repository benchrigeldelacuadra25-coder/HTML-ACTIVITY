        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
            The Mangkukulam is a figure in Philippine folklore often associated with witchcraft,
            curses, and supernatural knowledge. She reflects society’s fear of the unknown
            and powerful individuals.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            This story shows how fear can turn people against one another.
            I chose this legend because it reflects Filipino beliefs and values.
            It teaches respect, understanding, and accountability.
            The Mangkukulam represents misunderstood people in society.
            Folklore helps us understand our culture better.
            Through this story, I learned that legends often carry moral lessons.
