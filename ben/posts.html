        <h2>My First Week of School</h2>
        <span class="date">September 5, 2025</span>
        <p>
            My first week of school was both exciting and challenging. I met new
            classmates, explored the campus, and adjusted to my schedule.

        <h2>Why I Love Gaming</h2>
        <span class="date">October 12, 2025</span>
        <p>
            Gaming helps me relax after a long day of studying. It also improves
            my problem-solving skills and allows me to connect with friends.
